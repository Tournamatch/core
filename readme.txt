A ladder and tournament plugin for eSports, physical sports, board games, and other online gaming leagues.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to create tournaments and ladders (leader boards) on your website. Ladders track points, wins, losses, [optionally] draws, games played, win streak, and win percent. Tournaments support single elimination head-to-head competitions. It includes match challenges, player profiles, team profiles, ladder and tournament rule pages, match lists, and a player dashboard for managing everything.

This plugin is for active gaming communities! Registered users can create their own teams, join other teams, accept or decline join requests, drop team members, and send email or user team invitations; users can send match challenges; users or admins report, confirm, or dispute match results; ladders and tournaments will update automatically when match results are confirmed.

**Important**: This plugin is designed to work with BootStrap themes and will not look good without BootStrap. Template files are included in the plugin. You should consider copying those template files to a child theme. Block themes **are not** supported at this time.
